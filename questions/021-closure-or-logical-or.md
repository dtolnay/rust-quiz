# Hint

The `break` and `return` keywords have the same grammar in this question.

# Explanation

We want to know whether each possible parenthesization of `return || true;` and
`break || true;` evaluates to the closure `|| true` or to the unit value `()`.

- `let x = || { (return) || true; };`

    On this line, `x` is a closure that returns `()`. It is equivalent to `let x
    = || {}`. When we call `x().f()`, the method `f` resolves to `impl Trait for
    ()` which prints `2`.

    The type of the *expression* `(return)` is the primitive [never] type,
    usually written as `!`. It is legal to compute `! || true` because `!` can
    fill in for any type, in this case bool. The expression `! || true` is a
    logical-OR with bool on both the left-hand side and right-hand side.

    The behavior of `!` of filling in for any type is what allows us to write:

    ```rust
    fn f() -> bool {
        unimplemented!()
    }
    ```

    in which the type of `unimplemented!()`, since it panics without evaluating
    to any value, is also `!`.

    [never]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.never.html

- `let x = loop { (break) || true; };`

    Similar to `(return)`, the type of `(break)` is the never type `!`. This
    code breaks out of the loop with the implicit value `()`, so `x` is of type
    `()`. Calling `x.f()` will print `2`.

- `let x = || { return (|| true); };`

    On this line `x` is a closure that returns a closure that returns `true`.
    You could write `x()()` and that would be `true`.

    The quiz code calls `x().f()` which resolves to `impl<F> Trait for F where
    F: FnOnce() -> bool`. That trait impl prints `1`.

- `let x = loop { break (|| true); };`

    This is a loop containing a break-with-value expression. The argument of the
    `break` becomes the value of the enclosing `loop`. This code is equivalent
    to `let x = || true`.

    When we call `x.f()` it uses the `FnOnce` impl of `Trait` which prints `1`.

- `let x = || { return || true; };`

    Now we arrive at the meat of this quiz question. Is `return || true` parsed
    the same as `(return) || true` or as `return (|| true)`?

    It turns out to be the latter, so `x` is a closure that returns a closure
    that returns true. `x().f()` prints `1`.

- `let x = loop { break || true; };`

    Similar question here, is this `(break) || true` or `break (|| true)`?

    The break-with-value language feature was added to Rust more than two years
    after 1.0, in [Rust 1.19]. Prior to break-with-value, `break || true` was
    perfectly legal Rust code that parsed as `(break) || true`.

    In Rust 1.19 the behavior of this code was unintentionally broken by the
    language such that now it parses as `break (|| true)` and the printed value
    is `1`.

    If we had noticed this change in meaning during the development of Rust
    1.19, we may have adjusted the parsing to preserve the meaning of existing
    code. Unfortunately doing so would result in a grammar that behaves
    differently between `return` and `break` for no justifiable reason other
    than an accident of history.

    Or it is possible we would have ruled this an edge case of syntax that would
    never appear in real code, used [Crater] to validate that hypothesis, and
    broken the behavior intentionally.

The total output from `main` is `221111`.
